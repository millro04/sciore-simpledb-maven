I used a simple counter system to keep track of when each buffer was read in and unpinned. 
I also added a new field to the basic buffer class to keep track of the overall moveCount. 
Whenever a buffer is pinned or unpinned, I set that buffer's moveReadIn or moveUnpinned field. 
The various strategy implementations can then make use of the moveReadIn and moveUnpinned fields, as was demonstrated in the examples from the book and in class.
